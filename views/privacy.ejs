            <p>
              Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what information RankTiers collects, why it’s collected, and how it
              is used to deliver Minecraft leaderboards, submissions, and event support.
            </p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>
              We gather data that you provide directly—such as registration details, linked Minecraft accounts, and submission
              evidence—as well as limited technical data (like IP addresses) to protect the platform.
            </p>

            <h2>How Information Is Used</h2>
            <p>
              Data powers leaderboard updates, verifies event outcomes, awards achievements, and sends optional Discord
              notifications. We do not sell your personal information.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Sharing and Storage</h2>
            <p>
              Information is stored securely with Supabase and accessed only by authorized staff. We may share limited details
              with trusted services solely to operate RankTiers features.
            </p>

            <h2>Your Choices</h2>
            <p>
              Contact the RankTiers team to update or delete your account information. Removing a linked account stops future
              updates from that service.
            </p>

            <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
            <p>
              We occasionally revise this policy. The “Effective date” below reflects the latest update; continued use means you
              accept the changes.
            </p>
